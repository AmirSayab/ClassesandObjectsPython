In the context of matplotlib, the add_patch method is used to add a graphical shape (such as a circle, rectangle, etc.) to the current Axes instance, which represents the plot's coordinate system. The plt.Circle function, in this case, creates a circle shape, and add_patch adds it to the plot.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the add_patch method:

# plt.gca().add_patch(plt.Circle((0, 0), radius=self.radius, fc=self.color))


plt.gca(): gca stands for "get current axes." This function returns the current Axes instance associated with the current plot.

plt.Circle((0, 0), radius=self.radius, fc=self.color): This creates a circle object with the following parameters:

(0, 0): Specifies the (x, y) coordinates of the center of the circle. In this case, it's at the origin (0, 0) of the coordinate system.
radius=self.radius: Sets the radius of the circle. The self.radius indicates that the drawCircle method has an instance variable radius, and the value of this variable will be used as the radius of the circle.
fc=self.color: Sets the face color of the circle. The self.color suggests that there is an instance variable color in the class, and the circle will be filled with this color.
plt.gca().add_patch(...): The add_patch method is then called on the current Axes instance (obtained using plt.gca()). This method adds the circle, created in the previous step, to the plot as a graphical patch.

Overall, the code plt.gca().add_patch(plt.Circle((0, 0), radius=self.radius, fc=self.color)) combines the creation of a circle object using plt.Circle and then adds it to the plot using add_patch, effectively drawing the circle with the specified properties.
